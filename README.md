The F-value for treatment and the P-value indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the treatment.The null hypothesis can be rejected.
The F-value and P-value for Block indicates that the blocking factor is statistically significant.
From this two results we can reject the null hypothesis, that is that the treatment have the same effect and there is no effect from blocking.
For the second example
The P=-value(0.18997) is greater than 0.05 implying that treatement does not have a statistically significant effect on the outcome.
The P-value(0.000609) for the blocking factor suggest that the blocking variable explains a significant portion of the variability in the data and we can reject the null hypothesis that blocking has no effect
